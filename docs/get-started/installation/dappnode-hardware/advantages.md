# Advantages

The advantages of buying a DAppNode hardware are:

- Ease of Setup: You don't have to fret over custom hardware specifications, various driver issues that arise from using other hardware, install DAppNode from scratch, or troubleshoot some strange compatibility problems that arise from using hardware configurations that the team hasn't batttle-tested.
- Ease of Maintenance: DAppNode hardware is shipped and already updated to the latest version of DAppNode. You only have to set up access to your DAppNode to begin using it.
- Community Support: Using DAppNode hardware, you show your support for the DAppNode project ecosystem, and can get a special "Nodler" role in our Discord Server, publicly denoting your support to the ecosystem.  This lets staff and community support see instantly that you're running DAppNode hardware so it's easier to troubleshoot. Nodlers even get their own priority support channel on our Discord server, along with various other perks and surprises. (In the past we've given loyalty rewards in the form of various tokens, NFTs, POAPs, etc.)
