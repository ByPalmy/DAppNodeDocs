# Hardware Minimum and Recommended Specs

DAppNode must be installed in a dedicated machine. Although, the requirements you need depends in part on what you run in your DAppNode. We will recommend some minimum requirements just for the software to run, keep in mind these requirements are bare minimums and will not be enough for many functions of DAppNode.  Specifically if you plan to use your DAppNode for multiple EVM chains, you will need at least double or more of the below specs:

## **Minimum Specs** *(To Stake Ethereum and Gnosis, most common use case)*
- 32 GB RAM
- 2TB NVMe SSD Drive
- Wired Internet Connection
- Screen & keyboard (Only for initital setup and troubleshooting)

## **Recommended Specs** *(For Multiple EVM chains, multiple clients, more chains, with room to grow)*
- 64 GB RAM
- 4TB NVMe SSD Drive
- Wired Internet Connection
- Screen & keyboard (Only for initital setup and troubleshooting)

> :information_source: Requirements vary greatly for each usecase. Blockchain sizes change quickly, specs may be out of date.
