> **Note**
> *There are a decreasing amount of packages we maintain that can run on ARM64 Architecture.
> The Dappstore will have far fewer options since there are far fewer packages that support ARM64.
> Now that the Merge is passed we are working on getting some more clients to work on ARM64, but with higher CPU requirements and disk I/O requirements Pi Dappnoes are falling increasingly out of use.*
