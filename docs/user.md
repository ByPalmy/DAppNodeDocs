Welcome to the Dappnode user guide.

If you have just installed Dappnode on your own hardware or purchased a Dappnode from our [store](https://shop.dappnode.io/), the [Quick Start section](/user/quick-start/first-steps) will help you through the first steps with your Dappnode and get you on your way to exploring the Web3 ecosystem on your own terms.

If you want to run your own validator, access decentralised apps or learn how to do cool stuff on your Dappnode visit the [Guides section](/user/guides/).

If you have problems with your Dappnode or want to get in touch with us, please take a look at the [FAQs](/user/faq/general).

The [product manual](/user/product-manual/dashboard) aims to give you an overview of the whole Dappnode interface, accompanied by a functional explanation of that part of the UI.
