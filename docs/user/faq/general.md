  <summary>What is the purpose of the DAppNode?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>The main purpose or mission of DAppNode is to make it easy for everyone to participate in decentralized networks. Furthermore, DAppNode aims to increase the decentralization of blockchain infrastructure.</div>

  <summary>What can I do with DAppNode?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>The DAppNode platform lets you run nodes and applications interfacing with all different kinds of blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Gnosis Chain and many more in a easy and user-friendly way. 
    <br/> <br/>
    Furthermore, you can run validators or staking nodes in networks like Ethereum, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche and more to come.

  <summary>What hardware do I need to run a DAppNode?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
  You can run the DAppNode platform on various machines ranging from low-end hardware (such as old laptops) to high-end hardware (such as high performance servers).
  <br /><br />
  The resources you need will depend on how many and which kind packages you are going to run.
  <br /><br />
  The most <b>basic</b> hardware requirements you should meet are:
  <ul>
    <li>A Wired Ethernet Connection</li>
    <li>An SSD or faster (Size depends on amount of chains and packages - a good target is at least 500GB)</li>
    <li>8GB of RAM</li>
  </ul>

  If you intend to run a <b>Ethereum validator</b>, we recommend the following hardware specs:
  <ul>
    <li>A Wired Ethernet Connection</li>
    <li>An NVMe drive (we recommend at least 1TB but more storage space will not hurt either)</li>
    <li>16GB of RAM</li>
  </ul>

  <summary>What are the advantages of running a DAppNode?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
  The main advantages of hosting your own nodes with DAppNode are privacy, independence and the ease of setup.
  <br /><br />
  Once you're hosting your own nodes, you are not affected by outages at big providers like Infura (the default gateway in Metamask for many networks) anymore. This allows you to submit transactions without having to worry about a third-party.
  <br /><br />

  It is also beneficial to your own transactional privacy as major providers have been caught censoring transactions coming from specific countries ([Link](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059386712-Why-MetaMask-and-Infura-cannot-serve-certain-areas), [Link](https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1499423160957034496)).

  Furthermore, running blockchain nodes has never been easy as with the DAppNode platform. You install a package from our DAppStore and you're good to go. Automatic updates included.

  <summary>What is the difference between buying a DAppNode or installing a DAppNode by yourself?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    The underlying system is the same.
    <br /><br />
    The prebuilt DAppNode machine is built for people who do not want to worry about buying hardware themselves, looking up hardware requirements or installing the DAppNode software on compatible machines. The DAppNode software was meant to be used on those prebuilt machines but you can run it on any hardware regardless. 
    <br /><br />
If you want to install the DAppNode platform on an old computer or on custom hardware please check out the <a href="/user/quick-start/core">Guides here</a>.

<details>
  <summary>Is my Internet Connection fast enough?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>This depends on the amount of chains and applications you want to run on top of your DAppNode. 
    <br /><br />
    For a singular chain (for example Ethereum EL + CL) you'll need around 10 to 20 Megabits (up and down). Running more chains will increase the amount of bandwidth you need. 
    <br/> <br/>
    If you have any questions regarding your internet speed, you can hop into our Discord and ask a question in the #support channel.

<details>
  <summary>Do I need terminal or command line experience to use DAppNode?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>You generally wont need to use a terminal on your DAppNode unless instructed to in specific support cases. One of the key objectives of the DAppNode platform is to avoid using the terminal.
