This section covers different ways of accessing your DAppNode.  

We recommend that you start setting up basic access via [WiFi](wifi) (recommended!) or the [local proxy method](local) (this only offers a restricted DAppNode UI). 

> :warning: **Once you have that all set up and you realize want to access your DAppNode on the go, we suggest that you take a look at the [VPN](vpn) guides.** 
>
> **We highly recommend that you use the VPN option to access your DAppNode as this is by far the most secure and comfortable option.**
