# Local Proxy

If you are connected to the same local network as your DAppNode and you did the installation using the Script method. You should be able to access to the admin UI going to the url http://dappnode.local .  Depending on your network setup you may instantly gain access this way, or you may run into various errors when trying to load the link above.  If this occurs move on to another method of accessing your DAppNode.

# Note

When you use the local network proxy you are limited to the admin UI dashboard at `dappnode.local` and cannot access any other UI's such as the Web3Signer, Prysm, Avalanche, Mysterium, DMS, etc.  You must use a VPN (preferably Wireguard) or the DAppNode's own WiFi hotspot to access those pages.  The Local Proxy is designed as a convenience feature and is not really intended for regular use since you can only access the adminUI using it.

## Enable/Disable from UI

You can Enable/Disable this access method from the UI from the Wifi page, on the tab Local Network.
